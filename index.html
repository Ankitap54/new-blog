      <h2>Rose</h2>
      <p>Roses are known for their beauty and fragrance. They come in various colors, symbolizing love and passion.the history of the rose is very colorful. Roses have been naturally growing for over 35 million years! However, they were not known to be cultivated until about 5,000 years ago. Their usage began not just as a decorative touch to one’s home, but they were also used for medicinal purposes and to make perfumes, and their petals were even used as confetti for festive occasions. Getting your roses into water quickly is the first step in caring for them. Fill a vase three-fourths full of fresh, cool tap water. The roses will absorb the water, soaking up the nutrients that will travel up to the bloom and create a lively flower. </p>

With its roots latched in mud, it submerges every night into river water and miraculously re-blooms the next morning, sparklingly clean. As a result, this has led the lotus to have associations as the flower with rebirth and spiritual enlightenment.1</p>

        <h2>Sunflower</h2>
        <p>Sunflowers are one of the most popular flower types and are best known for their dazzling yellow color and large size. They generally symbolize adoration, loyalty, and longevity in the language of flowers. Native Americans view sunflowers as a symbol of harvest and bounty since the flower provides seeds and pigments, in addition to being visually beautiful. Sunflowers need direct sunlight for six to eight hours per day and require hot conditions to flower well. Sunflowers also have long roots that require plenty of room to spread out, so soil should be well dug and not too dense for growth.</p>
